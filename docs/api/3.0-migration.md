# 2.x to 3.x migration guide

The release of the `3.0` version of the library introduced many breaking changes in the API.

This document is provided to support migration from a `2.x` to a `3.x` version of the library.

## Version 3.0.0-alpha.0

#### Added better support for Companion Ads
* Companion value `type: String` is now only associated to `staticResources` and renamed to `creativeType`
* Changed companion value `htmlResource: String` to `htmlResources: Array<String>`
* Changed companion value `iframeResource: String` to `iframeResources: Array<String>`
* Changed companion value `staticResource: String` to `staticResources: Array<{url: String, creativeType: String|null}>`

#### Better extension parsing
Each `Extension` now has the format:
- `name: String|null` - extension name
- `value: any` - value inside extension (if it is another node it will be passed into children instead)
- `attributes: Object` - attributes of extension
- `children: Array<Extension>` - children nodes in the extension. They will be parsed with `Extension` format.

Extension won't be added to the parsed result if it contains no value, attributes and children.
Comments and empty strings will be ignored.

For example, this extension:
```xml
<Extensions>
	<Extension>
    { foo: bar }
  </Extension>
	<Extension type="Pricing">
		<Prices>
			<Price model="CPM" currency="USD" source="someone">
				<![CDATA[ 0 ]]>
			</Price>
			<Price model="CPM" currency="USD" source="someone">
				<![CDATA[ 234.5 ]]>
			</Price>
		</Prices>
		<PricingPolicy>
			<!-- Test of comment -->
			<![CDATA[http://example.com/pricing-policy.html]]>
		</PricingPolicy>
	</Extension>
	<Extension type="OverlyNestedExtension">
		<GreatFather age="70">
			<Father age="40" alive="false">
				<Daughter age="20">Maria</Daughter>
				<Daughter age="20">Lola</Daughter>
				<Son age="25">Paul</Son>
			</Father>
		</GreatFather>
	</Extension>
</Extensions>
```
Would be parsed as:
```js
{
  extensions: [
    {
      name:"Extension",
      value:"{ foo: bar }",
      attributes:{},
      children:[]
    },
    {
      name:"Extension",
      value:null,
      attributes:{"type":"Pricing"},
      children:[
        {
          name:"Prices",
          value:null,
          attributes:{},
          children:[
            {
              name:"Price",
              value:"0",
              attributes:{"model":"CPM","currency":"USD","source":"someone"},
              children:[]
            },
            {
              name:"Price",
              value:"234.5",
              attributes:{"model":"CPM","currency":"USD","source":"someone"},
              children:[]
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          name:"PricingPolicy",
          value:"http://example.com/pricing-policy.html",
          attributes:{},
          children:[]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      name:"Extension",
      value:null,
      attributes:{"type":"OverlyNestedExtension"},
      children:[
        {
          name:"GreatFather",
          value:null,
          attributes:{"age":"70"},
          children:[
            {
              name:"Father",
              value:null,
              attributes:{"age":"40","alive":"false"},
              children:[
                {
                  name:"Daughter",
                  value:"Maria",
                  attributes:{"age":"20"},
                  children:[]
                },
                {
                  name:"Daughter",
                  value:"Lola",
                  attributes:{"age":"20"},
                  children:[]
                },
                {
                  name:"Son",
                  value:"Paul",
                  attributes:{"age":"25"},
                  children:[]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### From babel 6 to babel 7
Vast-client now uses babel 7, so direct uses of the package `src` folder will need babel 7 in its own package to work.

#### NodeJS EventEmitter replaced with custom class
A lighter custom class with the same syntax has been created to replace nodeJS EventEmitter. API docs for custom class described [here](https://github.com/dailymotion/vast-client-js/blob/3.0-version/docs/api/event-emitter.md).

## Version 3.0.0-alpha.1

#### No more imports from `src`
`module` package.json entry with pre-build files has been replaced with `browser` entry pointing towards already built files. This is to facilitate packages still using babel 6 (as it is not compatible with babel 7).Check [README](https://github.com/dailymotion/vast-client-js/blob/3.0-version/README.md#api-documentation) file for more detailed info.

## Version 3.0.0-alpha.2

#### Companion ads in Wrapper elements are now parsed
Previously companion ads in `Wrapper` elements were being ignored. `companionClickTrackingURLTemplates` from wrapper companion ads are passed down to other companion ads.

## Version 3.0.0-alpha.7 (current version)

#### ⚠️ *Important* ⚠️ : Some attributes have been changed to include `id` values. Changes have been done to:
```
Ad {
  advertiser: Array<{ id: String|null, value: String }>
  impressionURLTemplates: Array<{ id: String|null, url: String }>
}

CreativeLinear {
  videoClickThroughURLTemplate: { id: String|null, url: String }|null
  videoClickTrackingURLTemplates: Array<{ id: String|null, url: String }>
  videoCustomClickURLTemplates: Array<{ id: String|null, url: String }>
}

NonLinearAd {
  nonlinearClickTrackingURLTemplates: Array<{ id: String|null, url: String }>
}

CompanionAd {
  companionClickTrackingURLTemplates: Array<{ id: String|null, url: String }>
}

Icon {
  iconClickTrackingURLTemplates: Array<{ id: String|null, url: String }>
}
```

#### The following classes have been replaced with objects:
```
 AdExtension (now called Extension)
 AdVerification
 Ad
 CompanionAd
 CreativeCompanion
 CreativeLinear
 CreativeNonLinear
 Creative
 Icon
 MediaFile
 Mezzanine
 NonLinearAd
 VASTResponse
```

#### Changes to requests
* `FlashURLHandler` has been removed. If it is needed from this point on, it should be passed as a custom url handler in options.
* Requests (`NodeURLHandler` and `XHRURLHandler`) now have a timeout of `120000ms` by default.

#### Improvents for VAST-resolving/VAST-resolved event logs
* `fetchVAST` can now be called with 2 more arguments `wrapperDepth` and `previousUrl`: `fetchVAST(url, wrapperDepth = 0, previousUrl = null)`
* Parameter `options` from `getAndParseVAST` is now optional: `getAndParseVAST(url, options = {})`
* property `rootURL` in `VASTParser` is now set after url template filter functions have been called.
* `parseVastXml` can now be passed additional properties in `options` object, `url` and `wrapperDepth`: `parseVastXml(vastXml, { isRootVAST = false, url = null, wrapperDepth = 0 })`


Due to a bug where `originalUrl` was being assigned not as the root url, but the previous url, the following has changed:
* `VAST-resolving` event payload now has field `originalUrl` correctly renamed to `previousUrl`.
* Parameter `originalUrl` from `resolveWrappers` has been correctly renamed to `previousUrl`: `resolveWrappers(ad, wrapperDepth, previousUrl)`
* `resolveAds` param `originalUrl` in `options` object has been renamed to `previousUrl`. It also can be passed `url` into `options`. For example: `resolveAds(ads = [], { url, previousUrl })`
* `options` parameter in `VASTParser` `parse` function now expects `previousUrl` instead of `originalUrl`. It also can be passed `url` into `options`.
