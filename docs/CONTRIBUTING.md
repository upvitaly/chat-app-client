# Contributing

:tada: Thanks for being here :tada:

We appreciate any kind of contribution: bug reports, feature requests and pull requests.

Please read the following sections before making your contribution.

## Report a bug / Request a feature
To report a bug or request a feature, please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/dailymotion/vast-client-js/issues/new) and follow the guidelines below.

### Report a bug
 * Explain the expected behaviour with a simple sentence
 * Label the issue as a `bug`
 * Provide the **steps** to reproduce your problem (if possible) or a simple **example** of code
 * Report the **version** of the library you are using
 * Is it a regression from a previous version?

### Request a feature or suggest an enhancement
If you see something that's missing or can be improved, please let us know!

 * Explain which feature/improvement you would like to be added to the library.
 * Label the issue as `feature`, `enhancement` or `discussion`
 * If you can, suggest how you would do that :sunglasses:
 * If you already coded it, feel free to open and link a pull request :man_technologist: :woman_technologist:

## Pull requests
Pull requests are welcome. Here is a quick guide on how to start.

 * Develop in a dedicated branch, not directly on master
 * If you add some logic, add some tests too
 * Make sure test are passing (`npm test`)
 * If you bundle the project, please don't commit the updated `vast-client.js` file in your PR. We'll take care of generating an updated build right before releasing a new tagged version.
 * Follow the commit guidelines below ðŸ‘‡
 * Label your PR with one of these three tags (Maintainers will then make the right release according to that)
    * `breaking-change`
    * `enhancement`
    * `fix`

## Commit messages
In order to keep a clean and clear commit history, please commit to the repo following these guidelines:

 * Mark each commit with one of the following tags:
    * `[client]` for commits involving `VASTClient` logic
    * `[parser]` for commits involving `VASTParser` logic
    * `[tracker]` for commits involving `VASTTracker` logic
    * `[util]` for commits involving utility components logic
    * `[test]` for commits adding or fixing tests
    * `[docs]` for commits involving documentation
    * `[tools]` for commits involving tooling
 * Add a short description of the changes made in the commit
 * If needed add a longer description in the following lines

Example:
```
[tag][subtag] short commit message
optional longer description of
what happens in this commit
```
```
